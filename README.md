# Advent of Code

My solutions for the Advent of Code yearly
challenges

The repository lacks the `input.txt`Â files
required for the codes to work for brevity
reasons.

### 2020

Given I'm best at JavaScript, I made my mission
not to use it. If I do use it, I'll accept
my defeat :D

## Usage

To run a particular day's solution, ensure that
you have the relevant tools installed and added
to your PATH.

For example, to run the solution for day 2, you
must ensure that you've installed Rust and Cargo.

For convenience, I have included a `run.sh` file
in the root of each year. You can use it like
this:

```sh
$ ./run.sh 14 # a day number
```

but you can omit the number and it'll ask you.
Alternatively, you can pipe it:

```sh
$ echo "1" | ./run.sh
```

# Contributing

Please don't :D

JK, you can contribute but please only do
that for the solutions that I have already
completed (doing otherwise would ruin the 
concept of AoC).
